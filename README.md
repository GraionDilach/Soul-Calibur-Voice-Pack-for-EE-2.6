# Soul Calibur Voice Pack for EE 2.6+

## Overview
This mod adds voicesets from the Soul Calibur series as selectable player voicesets to the Infinity Engine (Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate II/Icewind Dale) Enhanced Edition games version 2.6 or above.

## Limitations
Due to inconsistency between voicesets in the source games, not every voiceset covers every role. Discrepancies between characters are commonplace. The audio quality may also vary between the sets due to audio and mastering differences between the source games. Unless there's a really significant difference, reprised roles will not receive their own voiceset, but merged into enmriching one set.
